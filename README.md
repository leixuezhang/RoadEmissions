RoadEmissions
=============

Python library for emission calculations based on the EMEP/EEA emission guidebook 2013


This is a project to promote the use of detailed emission models for studies of emissions from road transports. The idea builds on the ideas developed in the research project Green Freight Transport and a PhD project by Tomas Levin, where detailed emission functions where used to calculate company specific emission inventories. The first Python emission toolkit is published on GitHub under the acronym SEMBA (SINTEF Emission Modules Based on ARTEMIS).

Much of the work in the ARTEMIS project has been taken up by the EMEP/EEA air pollutant emission inventory guidebook 2013 (http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/emep-eea-guidebook-2013/) and thus new emission factors while at the same level of detail have been added. This project is not a refactoring of the SEMBA module but rather a new model, that has a tighter link to formal emission functions provided by the EU.
